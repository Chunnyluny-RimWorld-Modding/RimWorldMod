## FAQ

### Can I add this mod to a save game?

Yes. No problem. You need to enable the items first so the pawns can interact with them; be aware any mod that adds new items, such as food, drugs, and clothing, is automatically disabled in stockpiles. Colonists will ignore them, and they will not haul or wear the item. When you just added this mod, the items are not automatically included in the stockpiles or recipes. This is not considered a bug or an error. You just need to tick them on for recipes or stockpiles etc. After you enable them, they will show up.

### Can I remove this mod from a save game?

I wouldn't advise it, as a general rule. If you really want to, start by backing up your saves, then get rid of all the mod-added items in your game and make sure none of your pawns/colony animals are wearing any apparel. No apparel/items is made at the tailor table etc. Make sure they are not stored in stockpiles, and pawns are not training animals, cancel any research related to this mod. Then you can try removing the mod. But I can't promise to help you if this breaks your save. That's what the backup is for.

### Any requirements for this mod to work?
Yes, list the mods with their steamlinks, if not, you can puts mods as suggestions they would work together, make sure people know it is a choice not a musthave.

It is recommmended to use a mod manager like [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases) or [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort) to install this mod. They are recommended and will help loading the mod in the correct order. These mod managers are more explained in details on my [Troubleshootingguide](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/troubleshootingguide/README.md). More information about this mod is found on [About.xml](DogApparel/About/About.xml)

### Combat Extended compatible?

Why wouldn't it be? I don't want to use [Combat Extended](https://github.com/CombatExtended-Continued/CombatExtended) because it doesn't work well with most of the mods I like. If you use Combat Extended and have info on mod compatibility, share your experience using both mods.

### Can I use this mod with [any other mods]?

Sure it will be possible. It's extremely unlikely for there to be any conflict between my mod and any other mod. If you do run into an incompatibility of any kind, though, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/RimWorldMod/issues/new)

### Steam or GitHub?

This mod is still in development and will be pre-released on Github before it is available on the SteamWorkshop, since I don't own RimWorld on Steam I can't upload it to the RimWorld workshop page.
