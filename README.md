## FAQ

### Can I add this mod to an ongoing save game?

Yes but you need to enable the items first, so the pawns can interact with them; be aware any mod that adds new items, such as food, drugs, and clothing, is automatically disabled in stockpiles. Colonists will ignore them, and they will not haul or wear the item. When you just added this mod, the items are not automatically included in the stockpiles or recipes. This is not considered a bug or an error. You just need to tick them on for recipes or stockpiles etc. After you enable them, they will show up.

### Can I remove this mod from a save game?

I wouldn't advise it, as a general rule. If you really want to, start by backing up your saves, then get rid of all the mod-added items in your game and make sure none of your pawns/colony animals are wearing any apparel. No apparel is made at the tailor table etc. Make sure they are not stored in stockpiles, and pawns are not training animals, cancel any research related to this mod. Then you can try removing the mod. But I can't promise to help you if this breaks your save. That's what the backup is for.

### Any requirement(s) for this mod to work?

Yes this mod is created to use the [Animal Gear](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1541438907). You should also use a mod manager like [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases) or [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort)
They make sure you load this mod in the right place. You can find more information about these mod managers in my [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/troubleshootingguide/README.md).

### Combat Extended compatible?

I have not made a patch to support Combat Extended, because I don't use [Combat Extended](https://github.com/CombatExtended-Continued/CombatExtended) myself.
If you use Combat Extended in your modlist and have more info about regarding the compatibility, please share your experience with both mods enabled.

### Can I use this mod with any other mod(s)?

I added textures for 11 Vanilla Animals Expanded dogs. I have checked before if there is any mod existing on the workshop that would would add the same items/features as my mod. But I have not found anything similar, so I believe it's quite rare to get any mod conflict. ```Place the 'Animal Gear' mod before this mod in the load order for proper functionality.``` You can provide me with incompatibility reports, by opening [an issue](https://github.com/Chunnyluny/DogApparel/issues/new).

### Steam or GitHub and when available for release?

This mod is still in development and will be released on Github whenever I find it feature finished. Since this mod is a collab it will be expanded upon. Because this is my first ever RimWorld mod, I appreciate any feedback or bugreports, so I can try to improve this mod.
I will prefer updating this mod on GitHub, since it is easier to implement new features and bugfixes through GitHub. When any Alpha version is ready to test out, feel free to star this repository to keep up-to-date and provide me with any feedback on functionality of this mod.
